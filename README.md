# Soil Health Prediction

## Overview:

Infering nutrients through Infrared Spectroscopy. Thousands of soil samples have been both scanned with (dry testing) and tested in the lab (wet testing), for a more complete soil profile. The goal is to predict the more detailed nutrient profile by using the coarser, but more efficient and affordable, infrared methods.

## Motivation:

Soil health is our health. Here we hope to improve our tools of assessing soil health and making them more available. Best ecological practices of agriculture can be measured and their efficacy can be proven. Here we are building the ability to use a cheap and quick method of soil health assessment such as a infrared scanning. Infrared scanning could be made widespread in smartphones. 

Infrared spectroscopy has traditionally provided great scientific insight. Here we can see how it can improve the quality of life of farmers and the whole ecosystem.
